# cookiecutter-pypackage-most-minimal

Differences to https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal:

- Markdown instead of reStructuredText for README
- Package version inferred from git tag
- No travis
- No tox
- Extended .gitignore

Now more similar to https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod
